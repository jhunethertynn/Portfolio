            <h2>Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation</h2>
            <p>Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. This goal focuses on providing universal access to safe and affordable drinking water, improving water quality, and promoting efficient water use. It also seeks to protect and restore water-related ecosystems, addressing challenges like water pollution, scarcity, and inadequate sanitation, which impact both human health and the environment.</p>
            <img src=images/sdg.jpg">
            <p>As a BSIT student, my skills in coding and technology align with this goal by enabling me to contribute to developing solutions like smart water management systems, data analysis tools for monitoring water resources, and apps for raising awareness about water conservation. My passion for technology and sustainability drives me to pursue innovations that can help optimize water use and improve access to clean water and sanitation for communities in need.</p>

                    We are solving the global water crisis through self-empowerment, onsite training, and sustainable water points.
                    
                    WHO is also an acronym for Womenâ€™s Health and Opportunity where we fight to eliminate all forms of violence including the cutting, selling, and trafficking of young girls. </h4>
